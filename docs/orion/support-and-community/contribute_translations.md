# Translations

Community members help Orion with translation support thereby making Orion globally accessible. 

If you are interested in helping us sign up at [https://localazy.com/p/orion-browser](https://localazy.com/p/orion-browser)

Select the language(s) or let us know what language we should add.

Remember it is a marathon and not a sprint, steady translation progress helps us humanize the web. 

As a token of appreciation for helping us make Orion more international we will be awarding official contributor status to select translators. 

We would like to say a big [thank you](../misc/kudos.md) to everyone who has contributed so far!
