# About

At Kagi, we envision a friendly internet where you can explore, learn, and interact with confidence and ease. Our mission is to humanize the web, making it more accessible, and centered around your needs. We're driven by our core purpose: to inform and educate, empowering you with knowledge and understanding in your digital journey. Every product we build reflects this commitment, designed without ads, trackers, or distractions, and completely free from surveillance.

Kagi (pronounced kah-gee) was founded in 2018 by [Vladimir Prelovac](https://vladimir.prelovac.com/) in Palo Alto, CA. Our advisory board includes [Raghu Murthi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghumurthi), [Dr. Norman Winarsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Winarsky), [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram) and [Rory Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Sutherland_(advertising_executive)).

Kagi was bootstrapped from 2018 to 2023 with ~$3M from the founder. In 2023, [we raised $670K](https://blog.kagi.com/safe-round) from our users in our first external fundraise, followed by [$1.88M in 2024](https://blog.kagi.com/what-is-next-for-kagi#3), again from our users, bringing our user-investors to 93.

We launched in [June 2022](https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-orion-public-beta) and maintain real-time growth and usage statistics at [kagi.com/stats](https://kagi.com/stats).

In early 2024, [Kagi became a Public Benefit Corporation](https://blog.kagi.com/what-is-next-for-kagi#4).

## What does "Kagi" mean?

The word "kagi" means "key" in Japanese.

Kagi is pronounced kah-gee. You can [listen to the pronunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig4VTr0rt4Q).

## Kagi Search logo

More Kagi assets are available on the [Kagi Assets](https://kagi.com/assets) page.

People sometimes ask: why does Kagi have a "g" logo rather than a "k"?

Our brand designer insisted the Kagi logo is "anchored" in the letter "g," and we had to agree. Besides, we can't let Google own the letter "g" too, can we? ;)

## Orion Browser logo

More Orion assets are available on the [Orion Press Kit](https://browser.kagi.com/press-kit/) page.

## Who is Kagi's mascot?

We simply call him "Doggo" for now. He's adorable! We have more [assets](https://kagi.com/assets) available.
