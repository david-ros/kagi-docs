# Exclude AI-Generated Images

As part of our efforts to humanize the web, our [Image Search](https://kagi.com/images) feature automatically downranks websites with a high amount of AI-generated content.

If you prefer to completely exclude websites with AI-generated images from your search results, you can use the **AI Images** filter.

Note that, since there is currently no reliable way to automatically identify AI-generated images, this feature relies on the websiteâ€™s reputation rather than analyzing individual images. As a result, some AI-generated content may still appear in the results.
