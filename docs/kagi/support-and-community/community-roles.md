# Community roles  
From day one, Kagi and Orion have been shaped by people who file thoughtful bug reports, suggest features, translate the UI, or simply help other users.  
To recognize and reward that energy, we created **two community roles**: **Contributor** and **Distinguished Member**, each with its own set of perks.  

## Contributor  

### Eligibility  
Earn **10 points** on either [Kagi Feedback](https://kagifeedback.org/) or [Orion Feedback](https://orionfeedback.org/). Points come from community reactions to your posts, bug reports, and feature suggestions (see [How points work](#how-points-work) below).  

### Perks  
- **Contributor role** in the [Kagi Discord](https://kagi.com/discord)  
- Access to **Contributor-only channels**  
- **Contributor badge** next to your name on both feedback forums  
- **Early access** to upcoming features and experiments  

## Distinguished Member  

### Eligibility  
You can qualify in two ways. Either accumulate **100 points** on the feedback forums, or make a **major contribution to the product**—for example, translating **more than 1,000 strings**. Translation guides are available for [Kagi](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/support-and-community/contribute_translations.html) and [Orion](https://help.kagi.com/orion/support-and-community/contribute_translations.html).  

### Perks  
- **Distinguished Member role** in Discord  
- Access to **VIP and Contributor channels**  
- **Distinguished Member badge** in both feedback forums  
- **First-in-line** access to brand-new features and experiments  

## How points work  

Forum points measure how much the community values your input. You receive them when you:  

- Post a new bug report or feature idea  
- Get an up-vote on any submission  
- Receive a “Like” on a comment or reply
