# Translations

Community members help Kagi with translation support thereby making Kagi globally accessible.

If you are interested in helping us, sign up at [https://localazy.com/p/kagi-search](https://localazy.com/p/kagi-search)

Select the language(s) or let us know what language we should add.

Remember it is a marathon and not a sprint, steady translation progress helps us humanize the web.

As a token of appreciation for helping us make Kagi more international we will be awarding Kagi Premium to select contributors.

We would like to say a big [thank you](./kudos.md) to everyone who has contributed so far!
