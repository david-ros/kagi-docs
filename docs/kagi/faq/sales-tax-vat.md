# Sales Tax / VAT FAQ

We have recently implemented changes to our billing process to comply with global tax regulations. This FAQ addresses common questions and concerns regarding these changes.

## Why was I charged more than I was previously?
We are now collecting sales tax / VAT. If you are in an affected jurisdiction the correct amount of sales tax/VAT is added to your renewal in order to comply with tax laws.

## Why are you collecting sales tax / VAT now?
We were not required to collect them initially, until hitting certain threshold. Due to Kagi's growth, we are now required by law to collect sales tax / VAT in many jurisdictions.

## When will this sales tax / VAT collection start?
- New users: April 11th, 2024. 
- Existing users: On the first subscription renewal on/after April 21st, 2024.

## How do you determine what tax percentage to charge me?
We rely on the billing address you provide at the time of your subscription purchase.

## Why does my receipt say the seller is “Kagi by Reach US”?
To efficiently handle the complexity of collecting sales tax globally, we have partnered with [Reach](https://www.withreach.com/) as our Merchant of Record. They act as a reseller of Kagi's services, allowing them to manage sales tax / VAT on our behalf.

## I see a charge in my bank statement from “RCH-KAGI.COM” or “RCH-KAGI”, is that a legitimate charge by Kagi?
Yes, this is how charges made by Reach on behalf of Kagi will show up in your bank statement. You may also see a temporary preauthorization charge of $1 USD or $0 USD. This is simply to confirm the validity of your credit card details and will disappear within a day or two.

## What if where I live there is no tax for digital services?
Your renewal cost will remain unchanged.

## I’m a tax-exempt entity, can I waive the tax charge?
Please enter your tax ID in the [billing portal](https://kagi.com/billing/portal) and depending on the jurisdiction taxes may be automatically waived going forward.

## Is there a way to view my upcoming invoice?
Yes, please visit the [billing portal](https://kagi.com/billing/portal).

## My billing address is outdated. How can I update it?
