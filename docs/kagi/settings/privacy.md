## Overview

- **Safe Search** — Choose whether to omit sensitive (mostly adult) material from general search results.
- **Image Safe Search** — Choose whether to omit explicit adult material from image search.
- **Save My Search History** — Currently this option cannot be turned on. Kagi does not save any searches by default. In the future, we may add features that will utilize your search history, and then we will allow you to enable this.
