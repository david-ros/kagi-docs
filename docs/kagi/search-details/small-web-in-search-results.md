# How is Small Web used in Kagi results?

One of the things that makes Kagi unique is our initiative to surface recent results from the [Small Web](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web) (a curated list of personal blogs and websites, as well as YouTube channels). Here's how it integrates with Kagi search results:

## Identifying Small Web Content
When clicking the shield icon next to any search result, Small Web content is distinguished by an image of Doggo appearing in the details window.

## Recent Content Promotion
Recent content from Small Web sites appears prominently in search results for 7 days after publication. This ensures fresh, relevant perspectives from independent creators are easily discoverable, especially valuable for current topics and discussions.

## Evergreen Content
While the focus is on recent content, older Small Web content may remain searchable through Kagi's index. High-quality evergreen content continues to appear in relevant searches, weighted appropriately based on search context and user needs.

## Small Web Purpose
Small Web surfaces authentic, personal content from independent creators who regularly share their expertise, experiences, and insights. By focusing on genuine, non-commercial content, it helps you discover thoughtful perspectives from individual voices across the internet, enhancing the diversity and quality of your search results.
